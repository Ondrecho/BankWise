TODO: The error indicates that the `searchParams` object in a Next.js app is being accessed directly, which is not recommended. To fix this, the `searchParams` object should be unwrapped using `React.use()` before accessing its properties. This change ensures that the `searchParams` are accessed correctly in a server component. However, I need to know which file the error is occurring in. Can you provide that?
